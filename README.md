eCYBERMISSION 2015 Arizona First Place
Collaborating with Captain Al DiBenedetto of the Scottsdale Fire Department, myself and 2 students that I recruited developed a concept to continuously track the spread of wildfires. A network of sensor "units" will be placed throughout wildland area, attached to trees. Each unit will regularly report environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. Each unit features a smoke detector and four long-range infrared sensors which can detect and report a wildfire much earlier than eye-witness reports. The real-time spread of wildfires can be determined as different units send reports relative to their location.

Each unit also features radio repeating capabilities. This was the recommendation of Captain DiBenedetto, who mentioned how difficult radio communication is in the often remote areas. Currently, radio repeater antennas must be set up before firefighters can begin taking action, preventing immediate action.

This concept won first place in Arizona in eCYBERMISSION 2015.
